SEARCHABLE PLATFORM SECURITY TODO LIST
======================================
Created: 2025-01-19

COMPLETED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
✅ 1. Add rate limiting (nginx limit_req module) - DONE
   - Updated BOTH nginx/conf.d/default.conf and default.local.conf with rate limiting
   - Different limits for auth (3/min), uploads (1/sec), general API (30/sec)
   - Works across all environments (local, beta, prod)

✅ 2. Add security headers to nginx - DONE
   - Added to both default.conf (HSTS, full CSP) and default.local.conf (basic headers)
   - Server tokens hidden, version info removed
   - Block common scanner paths (.php, .git, /admin, etc.)

✅ 3. Remove DEV_BYPASS_TOKEN entirely - DONE
   - Removed from api/routes/auth.py code completely
   - Removed from .env.secrets
   - No environment-specific config needed

✅ 4. Implement fail2ban for SSH and nginx logs - DONE
   - Created jail.conf (base config) and jail.local (environment overrides)
   - Custom filters for suspicious API patterns and auth failures
   - Setup script now interactive and works across different environments

REMAINING SECURITY TASKS:

MEDIUM-TERM ACTIONS (1-3 months):
---------------------------------
[ ] 1. Implement API rate limiting per user/IP
   - Add Redis for rate limit tracking
   - Implement Flask-Limiter or similar
   - Different limits for authenticated vs anonymous users
   - Track by user ID for authenticated requests

[ ] 2. Add WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules
   - Consider ModSecurity for nginx
   - Or use cloud WAF (Cloudflare, AWS WAF)
   - Block OWASP Top 10 attack patterns
   - Custom rules for your API structure

[ ] 3. Use Redis for JWT blacklist instead of DB
   - Install Redis container
   - Migrate JWT blacklist from PostgreSQL
   - Set TTL based on token expiry
   - Improve token validation performance

[ ] 4. Add monitoring/alerting for suspicious patterns
   - Set up Prometheus alerts in Grafana
   - Monitor failed login attempts
   - Alert on rate limit violations
   - Track 4xx/5xx error spikes
   - Unusual file upload patterns

[ ] 5. Implement proper CORS policy
   - Currently missing from Flask config
   - Use Flask-CORS extension
   - Whitelist only your frontend domains
   - Different policies for different endpoints

LONG-TERM ACTIONS (3-6 months):
-------------------------------
[ ] 1. Move to asymmetric JWT (RS256)
   - Generate RSA key pair
   - Update JWT signing/verification
   - Distribute public key safely
   - Rotate keys periodically

[ ] 2. Add API gateway with built-in security
   - Kong, Tyk, or AWS API Gateway
   - Centralized authentication
   - Built-in rate limiting
   - Request/response transformation

[ ] 3. Implement comprehensive logging and SIEM
   - ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
   - Or Splunk/Datadog/Sumo Logic
   - Correlate events across services
   - Detect attack patterns

[ ] 4. Regular security audits
   - Quarterly penetration testing
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite scans
   - Code security review

[ ] 5. Consider Cloudflare or similar DDoS protection
   - Hide origin server IP
   - DDoS protection
   - WAF rules
   - Bot management
   - SSL/TLS termination

ADDITIONAL SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS:
--------------------------------
[ ] Input validation and sanitization
   - Add request validation middleware
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Validate file types and sizes
   - SQL injection prevention

[ ] Secure file handling
   - Virus scanning for uploads
   - Store files outside web root
   - Generate random filenames
   - Validate MIME types

[ ] Database security
   - Use prepared statements everywhere
   - Implement row-level security
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Regular backups with encryption

[ ] Authentication improvements
   - Add 2FA support
   - Password complexity requirements
   - Account lockout policies
   - Session management

[ ] Infrastructure security
   - Regular OS updates
   - Docker image scanning
   - Secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
   - Network segmentation

DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
-----------------------
1. Deploy to beta for testing:
   - Git pull latest changes
   - Restart containers: ./exec.sh beta deploy-all
   - Test rate limiting and security headers
   - Verify DEV_BYPASS_TOKEN no longer works

2. Deploy to production:
   - Git pull latest changes  
   - Restart containers: docker-compose up -d
   - nginx config automatically includes security improvements
   - No special production config needed

3. Install fail2ban (on host server, not in Docker):
   - Copy fail2ban directory to server
   - Run: sudo ./fail2ban/setup.sh
   - Follow prompts to set log directory path
   - Monitor: sudo fail2ban-client status

MONITORING:
----------
- Check nginx logs for rate limit hits
- Monitor fail2ban bans: sudo fail2ban-client status
- Review Grafana dashboards for anomalies
- Regular security log reviews

NOTES:
------
- Test all changes in staging first
- Keep security patches up to date
- Document all security changes
- Train team on security best practices
- Have incident response plan ready
