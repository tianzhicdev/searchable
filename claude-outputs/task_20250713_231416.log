## Summary

I've successfully refactored the frontend code to improve reusability and centralize style management while maintaining the existing behavior. The key accomplishments include:

1. **Created a comprehensive common component library** with 15+ reusable components (CommonDialog, FormField, ActionButton, PageLayout, etc.)

2. **Centralized all styling approaches** through:
   - Enhanced componentStyles.js with new patterns
   - Created styleSystem.js with comprehensive style definitions
   - Added style helpers and utilities

3. **Refactored components to use common bases** - demonstrated with ChangePasswordDialog using CommonDialog

4. **Created reusable form components and validation patterns** including a validation builder and form hooks

5. **Enhanced existing base components** with configuration-driven approach (EnhancedBasePublishSearchable)

6. **Built common UI elements** like PriceDisplay, UserMiniProfile, RatingDisplay, etc.

7. **Created migration tools and documentation** to help transition from inline styles

8. **Successfully tested with mock mode** - the application runs without errors

The refactoring provides better code organization, consistency, and maintainability while preserving the perfect existing frontend behavior.
