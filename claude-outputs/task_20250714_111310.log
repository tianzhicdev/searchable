Task: rewrite CLAUDE.md to reflect the latest changes, stress 1. reusability of the code. 2. respect existing code styles. 3. centrally manage sql (backend), components and components styles (frontend)

=================
I've successfully rewritten the CLAUDE.md file with the following key improvements:

1. **Code Reusability** - Added as the #1 core development principle with clear guidelines to always check for existing implementations, reuse components/utilities, and follow DRY principles.

2. **Respect Existing Code Styles** - Emphasized as principle #2 with mandatory requirements to study existing patterns, match surrounding code style exactly, and use established patterns.

3. **Centralized Management** - Added as principle #3 with specific instructions:
   - Backend: ALL SQL queries must go through `data_helpers.py` 
   - Frontend: Use and extend existing components in `components/` directory
   - Styles: Use Material-UI theme and existing patterns

4. **Updated Development Flow** - Changed from "Make Changes" to "Study Existing Code → Find Reusable Components → Implement Using Existing Patterns"

5. **Added Code Examples** - Included concrete examples showing wrong vs correct approaches for both backend (SQL queries) and frontend (component creation).

6. **Clear Visual Emphasis** - Used bold text and ALL CAPS for critical points like "REUSABLE UI COMPONENTS - CHECK HERE FIRST" and "ALL DATABASE OPERATIONS GO HERE".

The updated CLAUDE.md now strongly emphasizes these three principles throughout the document, making it clear that code reusability and respecting existing patterns are paramount in this codebase.
