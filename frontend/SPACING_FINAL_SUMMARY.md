## ðŸ”§ Remaining Edge Cases

While the core implementation is complete, there are still ~40 files with hardcoded spacing values. These are mostly in:
- Static pages (FAQ, Terms, etc.)
- Onboarding flow components
- Some payment views
- Various edge case components

These can be updated as needed during regular maintenance, but the main user-facing components are all properly responsive now.

## ðŸ“± Testing Recommendations

1. **Mobile Devices**
   - iPhone SE (375px) - Smallest common viewport
   - iPhone 12/13 (390px) - Standard mobile
   - iPad Mini (768px) - Tablet view

2. **Key Areas to Test**
   - Login/Register forms
   - Search functionality
   - Profile pages
   - Payment flows
   - Dialog interactions

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

The responsive spacing system is now in place and working throughout the application. Any new components should:
1. Import spacing utilities from `/utils/spacing.js`
2. Use `componentSpacing` helpers for common patterns
3. Apply `touchTargets` for interactive elements
4. Test on mobile viewports

The app now provides a significantly better mobile experience while maintaining a clean, spacious desktop layout!
