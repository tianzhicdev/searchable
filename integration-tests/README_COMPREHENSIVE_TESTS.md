## 🚀 Running the Tests

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Run all comprehensive tests
./run_comprehensive_tests.sh

# Run specific test suite
python -m pytest test_comprehensive_scenarios.py -v -s

# Run with coverage reporting
python -m pytest test_withdrawals.py --cov=api_client -v
```

### **Test Configuration**
Environment variables are automatically set by the `exec.sh` script:
```bash
# Local testing
./exec.sh local test

# Beta testing
./exec.sh beta test

# Production testing
./exec.sh prod test
```

### **Test Data Management**
- Tests create unique users with UUID-based names
- All test data is isolated per test run
- Automatic cleanup after test completion
- Logs stored in `logs/` directory with timestamps

## 📊 Test Results Analysis

### **Success Metrics**
- **Expected Pass Rate**: 85-95% (some endpoints may not be implemented)
- **Performance**: Individual tests complete within 2-10 seconds
- **Reliability**: Tests handle network delays and API variations
- **Coverage**: All major user workflows validated

### **Common Failure Scenarios**
1. **Endpoint Not Implemented**: Some advanced features may not exist yet
2. **Network Timeouts**: Adjust timeouts in `config.py` for slow environments
3. **Authentication Issues**: Verify API server is running and accessible
4. **Database State**: Clean database state recommended for best results

### **Interpreting Results**
- ✅ **GREEN**: Endpoint working correctly
- ⚠️ **YELLOW**: Endpoint exists but may have issues
- ❌ **RED**: Endpoint missing or seriously broken
- 🔧 **BLUE**: Test skipped due to missing dependencies

## 🛠️ Extending the Test Suite

### **Adding New Tests**
1. Create new test file following naming convention: `test_[feature_name].py`
2. Extend `api_client.py` with new endpoint methods
3. Add test file to `run_comprehensive_tests.sh`
4. Update coverage documentation

### **Test Structure Template**
```python
import pytest
import uuid
from api_client import SearchableAPIClient
from config import TEST_USER_PREFIX, TEST_EMAIL_DOMAIN, DEFAULT_PASSWORD

class TestNewFeature:
    @classmethod
    def setup_class(cls):
        # Test setup
        pass
    
    @classmethod  
    def teardown_class(cls):
        # Cleanup
        pass
    
    def test_01_feature_setup(self):
        # Initial setup test
        pass
    
    def test_02_feature_operation(self):
        # Main functionality test
        pass
```

### **Best Practices**
- Use sequential test numbering (01, 02, 03...)
- Include descriptive test names
- Verify both success and failure cases
- Clean up test data
- Use meaningful assertions
- Add comprehensive logging
