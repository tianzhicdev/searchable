[2025-07-13 22:15:59] Starting task: there are still a lot of  "conn = get_db_connection() cur = conn.cursor() execute_sql ... cur.close() conn.close()" in /Users/biubiu/projects/searchable/api-server-flask/api/common/data_helpers.py, /Users/biubiu/projects/searchable/api-server-flask/background.py,  we should perhaps refactor them using utils in api-server-flask/api/common/database_context.py. in fact we should reexamine all sql calls in api-server-flask to have them centrally managed & remove boilerpalte code.
